# 🦄✨ UwU NFT Collections ✨🦄

This magical project is a web application for browsing and interacting with UwU NFT collections on the Solana blockchain. 🌈🔮

Created with love and sparkles by the UwUPunks team! 💖🎀

## 🎠 Features

- 🖼️ Browse enchanting UwU NFT collections
- 👛 Connect your Solana wallet with a sprinkle of magic
- 📊 Live UwU token price tracker (watch the sparkles fly!)
- 🧮 SOL to UwU conversion calculator (math, but make it magical)
- 🎨 Theme switcher (because every unicorn needs options)

## 🚀 Setup

1. 🔮 Clone the repository (like summoning a friendly familiar)
2. 🌟 Open `index.html` in a web browser (your portal to the UwU realm)
3. 🔑 Make sure to replace `your_magic_eden_api_key_here` and `your_solscan_api_key_here` in `script.js` with your actual API keys (they're like secret unicorn passwords)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🌈 HTML5 (the canvas for our digital art)
- 🎨 CSS3 (sprinkle on the styles)
- ✨ JavaScript (where the magic happens)
- 🌙 Solana Web3.js (blockchain wizardry)
- 🖼️ Metaplex (NFT sorcery)
